What was immediately obvious was that the AB-turn (loop between A and B strand of the alpha1 domain beta sheet) deviates quite significantly between the chicken and human structures. Aligning all of the known chicken structures suggests this is potentially a common feature. An analysis of the differences in other species will be a key task added to the backlog. </p>\n<p>This deviation in the structure would make using a \"nearest structural neighbour\" approach for creating the  renumbered structure potentially difficult. This was confirmed by writing a quick piece of prototype code which indeed showed that the nearest neighbours for some of the chicken positions were not the ones relating to the IMGT numbering. This code however may be useful in looking at MHC molecules more generally and the peptides in particular. \u00a7 One thing which is under consideration from the initial piece of analysis is creating a dataset about 3D variance in MHC molecule structures.</p>\n<p>The second activity was around looking at sequence alignments between the chicken and human molecules. This was performed using <a href=\"https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/\">MAFFT</a> with and without <a href=\"https://sysimm.org/dash/\">DASH</a> which includes information from structural homologs. The alignments with DASH seemed to better predict the correct places for the insertions and deletions. A method to parse these alignments and turn them into maps for renumbering is a task added to the backlog.</p>\n<p>Finally, a closer look at the IMGT website shows that they have mapping tables for individual structures. An analysis of the usefulness of these tables has been added to the backlog. Whilst this is useful data it will only help for renumbering structures for which there are experimentally derived structures, and one goal for this feature is to be able to correctly number all structures, including those derived from structure prediction methods.</p>\n<p>I also presented at the OpenTargets lab meeting and had a day of annual leave, so the week wasn't a complete one.</p>"}, "week_1_hello_ebi_arise": {"metadata": {"title": "Hello EBI/ARISE", "week": 1, "year": 2023, "month": 1, "day": 20, "tags": ["starting", "new_desk", "month_one"], "slug": "week_1_hello_ebi_arise"}, "content": "<p>I started the ARISE fellowship, which runs for three years on the 16th January 2023.

From this analysis there are two clear first tasks which are quite foundational to work going forwards: </p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-small\">IMGT numbering of structures</h3>\n<p>The structures from the PDB have a variety of different residue numberings. The majority are numbered sequentially with residue 1 being the first residue after the signal peptide. Some structures however are numbered with residue 1 being the first amino acid of the signal peptide. The variety of numbering is further complicated by the MHC molecules of some species having deletions or insertions within the antigen-binding domains.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the IMGT has created a <a href=\"https://www.imgt.org/PDF/DCI/29_917-938_2005.pdf\">numbering scheme</a> to provide an elegant solution to this problem. This particular task is to develop an automated way to apply the IMGT numbering scheme to MHC Class I structures from the PDB and to develop an automated way to test/validate the assignment. </p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-small\">Looking at ways to link IPD/IMGT allele names to data within Open Targets</h3>\n<p>There is a wealth of information in OpenTargets and the GWAS catalogue which would provide disease association context for a future feature on \"histo\" which is a page for each allele, with information on polymorphism locations, motifs if known, immunopeptidome/epitopes and structural data/predictions. </p>\n<p>Currently, OpenTargets uses ENSEMBL ids as search criteria and stores information about potentially associated variants keyed against HGVS descriptions. This information is available on the <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ipd/pl/hla/get_allele_hgvs.cgi?A*02:01:01:01\">IPD-IMGT/HLA database (example for HLA-A*02:01)</a> and this has potential to create linkages. One interesting opportunity that arises from this is to create <a href=\"https://schema.org/sameAs\">\"SameAs\"</a> type mappings and make them publicly available.</p>"}, "week_6_a_slight_detour__due_to_an_exciting_workshop_not_for_public_sharing": {"metadata": {"title": "A slight detour, due to an exciting workshop not for public sharing", "week": 6, "year": 2023, "month": 2, "day": 24, "tags": ["reading", "workshop", "month_two"], "slug": "week_6_a_slight_detour__due_to_an_exciting_workshop_not_for_public_sharing"}, "content": "<p>This week felt like a bit of a detour, but in a good way.
