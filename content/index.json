First an introduction and some background.</p>\n<p>I'm Chris, I'm a bioinformatician/software developer/immunologist. I have been awarded an EMBL and the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) <a href=\"https://www.embl.org/about/info/arise/programme-overview/\">ARISE fellowship</a> to build tools for immunologists to use. Primarily the tools are related to the Class I and Class II molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex that present antigen to T-cells. </p>\n<p>The aim of the work is to pull together data and tools to allow immunologists, structural biologists and machine learning developers to answer some specific questions such as these below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what governs the motif and conformation of peptides bound to MHC molecules and how does this change the shape of the peptide binding cleft</li>\n<li>what governs the three-dimensional recognition of MHC:peptide complexes by T-cells</li>\n<li>what data exists about peptide repertoires and how can this data be used to extrapolate to MHC alleles with no data</li>\n<li>what is the structural variablity between MHC alleles, MHC molecules of different species and between specific MHC:peptide complexes and how can this information be used predictively</li>\n<li>what is the role of each position within the MHC molecule, how can this data be used to explain biological phenomena (such as TAPBPR dependence and independence)</li>\n<li>what can we understand from data about the effects of peptide processing and transcript level in the cell to better predict epitope sequences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aim of the ARISE fellowship is to learn how to build and deliver \"research infrastructures\" such as \"histo\". These will be built using user centric design/development methods and, in this case in particular, by \"working in the open\". This means that I'll be sharing the process as well as the outputs/outcomes so that as much of the learning can be shared as quickly as possible. Hopefully there will be publications infolved in this process, but these \"weeknotes\" will help as a regular and immediate view into the project.</p>"}, "week_4_prioritising_first_tasks": {"metadata": {"title": "Prioritising first tasks", "week": 4, "year": 2023, "month": 2, "day": 3, "tags": ["starting", "pids", "agile", "user_centric"], "slug": "week_4_prioritising_first_tasks"}, "content": "<p>Some <em>markdown</em> in here</p>"}, "week_2_getting_started": {"metadata": {"title": "Getting started", "week": 2, "year": 2023, "month": 1, "day": 27, "tags": ["starting", "pids", "agile", "user_centric"], "slug": "week_2_getting_started"}, "content": "<p>Some <em>markdown</em> in here</p>"}}}
